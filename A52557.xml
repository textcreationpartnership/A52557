            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>OUR Father Abraham is highly commended in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for two things with reſpect to his Family, beſides his own Faith and Piety, that the Scripture gives account of: ſo we have his care with reſpect to his Family,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>To Teach them Piety.</hi> Gen. 18.19. <hi>I know A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, there is none like him in all the earth, he will command his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and his houſhold in the wayes of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>We have his care to inſtruct them in Military Diſcipline,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in theſe words, <hi>he armed his trained Servants,</hi> ſuch as he had <hi>Trained</hi> up to be fit for ſuch a piece of Service as God by his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence called him to: His <hi>Trained</hi> or inſtructed Servants for ſuch a ſervice, prepared for it by inſtruction or by <hi>Training,</hi> which is our u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual word for ſuch an end. This labour and care of Abraham in this work, is much commended, from his ſucceſs in War, or his martial Exploit, of which we have an account in this Chapter. And that Abraham undertakes War, and ſucceſfully, and gets a Bleſſing by it, <hi>Melchizedech</hi>'s Bleſſing in his return out of the Field: we ſee,</p>
            <p>That the higheſt practice of Piety and practice of War, may agree well in one perſon. Religion and Arms may well be joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; they agree ſo well together, that the Lord aſſumes the name to himſelf, <hi>The Lord is a Man of War, the Lord is his name.</hi> It is the firſt ſong that ever was penned to celebrate Gods praiſes, in that Song <hi>God is magnified for this,</hi> as if it were one of his higheſt and chiefeſt Attributes, <hi>The Lord is a man of War:</hi> The Creation is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked, and the firſt piece of praiſe given to God is, <hi>The Lord is a Man of War.</hi> Exod. 15.1, 2, 3. <hi>I will ſing to the Lord, for he hath
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64965:4"/>triumphed gloriouſly, the horſe and his Rider hath he caſt into the Sea, the Lord is a Man of War, the Lord is his name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Chapter we have the firſt mention in ſacred Story of any warlike exploit; not but that there had been war before, as is implyed in the beginning of the Chapter, the Kings of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> had ſerved <hi>Chedarlaomer</hi> twelve years, in the thirteenth year they rebelled, in the fourteenth year, he with three other Kings makes War upon them, and he overcomes them and takes <hi>Lot</hi> Captive; and this is the firſt mention of any Battle fought, and as eminent an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of valour in Abraham and his Army, as is in the whole Book of God; for though Gideon and three hundred men, fought with a great Army, yet there was a great deal more Stratagem on his part: his pitchers with lamps in them, being broken in the night put a fright on the enemy; but Abraham fairly won his battel with dry blows. It is the firſt exploit of a Chriſtian Souldier, the firſt time we read of any Chriſtian Souldier being in arms, or of a religious Captain with his Army of Religion and arms joyned together, this account of Abrahams arming his own Servants.</p>
            <p>In this piece of Story, four things are hinted,</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The Occaſion of Abrahams arming his Souldiers at this time; <hi>When Abraham h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ard that his brother Lot was taken Captive.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. We have an account of the Generall of the Army in this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking or War, and that is <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. We have an account of his Souldiers, 1. The number of them, <hi>they were three hundred and eighteen.</hi> 2. The Quality of them they were <hi>trained men,</hi> they had their arms ready, and skill to make uſe of them: He preſently takes Arms, he had not arms to ſeek, nor men to learn how to make uſe of them; but every thing was ready, fit to purſue and overtake the enemy.</item>
               <item>4. We have the ſucceſs of it, with the conſequents thereof: the ſucceſs, he recovers his Brother Lot, beats the enemy, wins a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat victory takes all the Captives. The Conſequents of it were,
<list>
                     <item>1. He gets a Bleſſing of <hi>Melchizedech</hi> for it. Melchizedech that was eminently a Type of Jeſus Chriſt. God did ſo far own and encourage Abraham in this undertaking, that he would not let this action goe without a ſpecial Bleſſing, to encourage Souldiers in a lawfull War. He hath the ſpecial bleſſing of Chriſt; it is more than if an Angel had done it. Melchizedech ſo eminently repreſenting
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64965:4"/>Jeſus Chriſt, who is a Prieſt for ever after the order of Melchize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dech.</item>
                     <item>2. His Reſtauration of the goods and perſons to the King of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; in which he ſhews as much of nobleneſs or gallantry of ſpirit; as in fighting with <hi>Chedarlaomer.</hi> The King of Sodom offers Abraham to take the goods, if he would reſtore the perſons. No ſaith Abraham, I will not take the leaſt from a thread to a ſhoe latchet, leſt the king of Sodom ſhould ſay, he had made Abraham rich. It ſhews it was not for gain or advantage he had ventured his life, his ſpirit was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove it. It was not any reward from men that he expected, but was contented with the bleſſing of God, that rich bleſſing which he got. It was a great piece of praiſe (but in a bad cauſe) of <hi>Siſera</hi>'s ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that came to the waters of <hi>Tanach</hi> and fought, they took no gain of money: had it not been in a bad cauſe, it had been an high commendation of them, but it was in a wicked Cauſe, and ſo they loſt the praiſe which otherwiſe had belonged to them. Thoſe ſouldiers of Jeſus Chriſt, that valued not their lives to the death, will ſhew themſelves to be of the ſame ſpirit that Abram was, that will not ſo much look at gain, or reward of men, as the advancement of a good Cauſe.</item>
                  </list>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>But to hint ſomething to you from the words,</p>
            <p n="1">1. From the occaſion of Abrahams taking up arms, <hi>When Abram heard his brother Lot was taken Captive,</hi> or his Nephew, he was his brothers ſon, it was for the reſcue of his Kinſman. To take up arms for the defence of friends and Allies is lawfull. To take up arms for ſuch as are confederate with us, for united Colonies or Provinces from this example of Abraham and his confederate, that were enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in a league, offenſive and defenſive; So <hi>Anar, Eſhcol</hi> and <hi>Mamre</hi> were confederate with him. Though here be not an expreſſion of ſuch a league, yet there was a great friendſhip and relation between him and <hi>Lot;</hi> and through Abrams wiſdome, they parted lovingly, though they did part and could not live together, therefore Abram engageth in a War for the reſcue of <hi>Lot</hi> and his Family.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Hence our late War was juſtifiable, though the Quarrel was firſtly with our neighbours.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Hence conſequently, it is lawfull by war to defend what we have lawfully obtained and come by, as our poſſeſſions, lands and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance here, to which we have as fair a title as any ever had, ſince
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64965:5"/>Iſraels title to Canaan. Theirs was not only a gift of Providence, but of Promiſe. Ours we can call only a gift of Providence but yet ſuch as we may lawfully defend. As Jephthah ſaid to the Children of Ammon, <hi>What Chemoſh thy God gives thee to poſſeſs, wilt thou not poſſeſs it?</hi> So what God hath providentially given us, without inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to others, is that which we may lawfully defend.</p>
            <p>There are commonly reckoned three cauſes of War,</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. For defence of our ſelves.</item>
               <item>2. To recover what hath been taken away.</item>
               <item>3. To puniſh for injuries done.</item>
            </list>
            <p>But to paſs by the occaſions of the War; through the goodneſs of God we have peace. Abram arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his trained ſervants, or Souldiers, three hundred and eighteen: the number was ſmall to encounter with four Kings ſuch as they were <hi>Chedarlaomer</hi> being ſuppoſed to be <hi>Nimrods</hi>'s ſucceſſor, and <hi>Tidal</hi> King of Nations could not be a mean Prince, or have a ſmall number of Souldiers: ſo that three hundred and eighteen men muſt in reaſon be but a very ſmall handfull or number to encounter with ſuch an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, an Army heightned with ſucceſs, fluſhed with victory over the five Kings of Sodom and Gomorrah, and thoſe neibouring cities. They had a great Army for number, in probability though it be not e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>preſſed; they had an army that was heightned with ſucceſs, their ſpirit &amp; courage was which makes men abundantly more conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Take men fluſhed with ſucceſs they will undertake any thing, though very hazardous. Here was but a little handfull to goe out againſt ſuch an army. But what is it that a few men will not dare to doe, if the Cauſe, the Courage, the Conduct be but like that of Abram.</p>
            <p>But to note ſome things from the words, <hi>Abram armed his trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Servants:</hi> Abram was eminent in his place,
<list>
                  <item>1. For preparation before War, his ſervants were trained men.</item>
                  <item>2. For his carriage in the buſineſs and management of it, when he undertook it.</item>
               </list>

            <p>I ſhall ſpeak chiefly to the firſt of theſe,</p>
            <p>Doctr. <hi>That the Training of Souldiers to be fit for War, is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable practice, yea a Duty of great Conſequence, or not of the loweſt rank.</hi> or thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Frequent Trainings for the inſtructing of men in military Diſcipline that they may be ready and expert for War, is a commendable practice,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64965:5"/>yea a Duty which God expecteth of all Gods Abrahams in their reſpective places:</hi> that is, by Gods Abrahams in their reſpectve places, I mean ſuch as are meerly civil Rulers, to encourage ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes by their authority and preſence, when convenient. Such as are military officers, it is their duty actually to inſtruct men; ſuch may be ſuppoſed to repreſent Abraham, and God doth expect it from them, that they ſhould take care of this part, which <hi>Abraham</hi> acted ſo happily to ſo good end; And which is the conſequent of this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Doctrine, It is the duty of thoſe that would be accounted of Abrahams Family to learn of them, whom God requires to teach them the uſe of their weapons, and order of War. If it be Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams duty to teach, it is the duty of Abrahams ſervants, thoſe that repreſent them to learn of thoſe God ſets over them, the uſe of their weapons, and the order of War, that they may be expert for Warr. It is a commendation of a people or of ſouldiers to be expert for war, that which the Scripture frequently mentioneth, I ſhall look but to two places, 1. <hi>Cron,</hi> 12.33, 35, 36. in many verſes of that Chapter, <hi>of Zebulun ſuch as went forth to battle, expert for war, with all inſtruments of war, fifty thouſand that could keep rank.</hi> Here was <hi>Training</hi> up men to be expert and fit for War. And ſo in the following verſe, <hi>of the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites, expert for War, twenty eight thouſand; of Aſher ſuch as went forth to battle, expert in War, fourty thouſand.</hi> In that Song of Solomon, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.7, 8. <hi>Behold his bed which is Solomons, threeſcore valiant men are about it, of the valiant of Iſrael, they all hold ſwords, being expert in War. Every man hath his ſword upon his thigh, becauſe of fear in the night.</hi> It is an high Commendation of any people, when care is taken by Rulers, and people are willing to learn, and hearken to Rulers, that they may be inſtructed to be expert in war. It is a part of the general Calling, whereto God calls every man that is capable (not impotent men nor children) but according to that time the Scripture reckoneth, from twenty years and upward, all that were ready to go forth to war. It is not a thing by the by, but that which men ſhould make their buſineſs. It is a duty and praiſe-worthy piece of skill, to be <hi>expert for war.</hi> To be good ſouldiers is a matter of praiſe or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, which made the Apoſtle uſe it in a ſpiritual ſence, <hi>therefore my Son endure hardneſs as a good ſouldier of Jeſus-Chriſt.</hi> 2. Tim. 2.3. It is a ſtrange piece of dotage befallen this crazy headed Age, that men ſhould not uſe the ſword: the beſt of men have done it, and it hath been reckoned among their moſt praiſeworthy actions, that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64965:6"/>they have uſed the ſword. Of ſome it is ſaid, that <hi>their hands did cleave to their ſwords,</hi> they were ſo much in the uſe of it ſo happily for the advantage of the Church. The Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews Cap.</hi> 11.33.34. when he makes mention of the Worthyes, he mentioneth theſe two together, <hi>Who through Faith ſubdued Kingdoms, wrought righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs;</hi> they two may well go together: that is reckoned one of the great works of their Faith; there is not any thing wherein the glory of the Faith of many Believers did more ſhine forth, then in the uſe of it in War. There is no higher occaſion ordinary or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, wherein we have a higher opportunity or uſe for Faith, &amp; ſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Graces. A Souldier may be and ſhould be an holy man and the more fit he is for a Souldier. But that it is a duty of great Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, I ſhall ſpeak to the Doctrine in theſe two parts.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. It is a commendable practice.</item>
               <item>2. It is the duty of Gods Abrahams to have a care of this work to inſtruct ſouldiers that they may be fit for War:</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. It is a commendable practice, that may appear in four or five things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In that the Lord himſelf doth claim the honour of it: if it were not an honourable work, God would not challenge the honour of it, <hi>He teacheth my hands to war, and my fingers to fight.</hi> Military skill is ſuch a piece of divine wiſdome, that the Lord will not looſe the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of it. If every good and perfect gift be from him, he doth chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge every good and perfect gift as from him, but peculiarly claims the honour of this gift, of giving Military skill: God is the Author of it, <hi>The Lord is a Man of War, the Lord is his Name.</hi> That the Lord doth claim the honour of it, I might ſhew you by induction of Particulars or by inſtances. Every thing, every part that belongeth to a Souldier, God challengeth or claims as being from him, every thing that is honourable or praiſe-worthy,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The giving Spirit and Courage to men, of raiſing up the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of men, that he claims as being from him. <hi>Jer.</hi> 5<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, 11. <hi>Make bright the arrows, gather the ſhields; the Lord hath raiſed up the ſpirits of the Kings of the Medes.</hi> He raiſeth up mens ſpirits, when they are raiſed up for war; God hath a hand in it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God challengeth this, he teacheth to make weapons of War and the uſe of them. God doth not only give ſpirits to ſuch a work, but teacheth the framing and making of weapons, and hath a hand in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64965:6"/>the whetting and furbiſhing of them. He directeth the Smith to form or frame weapons for war, <hi>Iſar.</hi> 54.16, 17. to ſhew that he hath the ordering of the uſe of weapons. <hi>Behold I have created the Smith that bloweth the coal in the fire, and that bringeth forth an inſtrument for his work. And I have created the Waſter to deſtroy, and no weapon that is formed againſt thee ſhall proſper.</hi> God uſeth it as an Argument to encourage his people to truſt in him, there is no weapon of War, but I do direct to the making of it. He whets the ſword, and furbuſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it to the battel: <hi>if I whet my glittering ſword, and my hand take hold on vengeance,</hi> Deut. 32.41. He looks to the forming of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, He teacheth men the ordering of the battel: God doth give that wiſdome alſo to the Sons of men, he teacheth them by the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his own Hoſt, the Stars: But more eſpecially he provideth a Captain for his own Hoſt, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 5.14. <hi>It came to paſs, when Ioſhua was by Jerecho, he lift up his eyes and looked, and behold there ſtood a man over againſt him with a ſword drawn in his hand; and Ioſhua went to him and ſaid unto him, Art thou for us or for our adverſaries? And he ſaid nay, but as Captain of the Hoſt of the Lord am I now come.</hi> It was an Angel appeared. When any Hoſt of his is called forth, the Lord doth take care, as he did for Iſrael, when he intended to poſſeſs them of Canaan he ſent his Angel to goe along with them; he was inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, conſtantly with them; for he came to be as Captain of the Lords Hoſts. And therefore that good King encourageth the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>the Lord is with us to fight our Battels.</hi> He hath a hand in order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the battel, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.8. He appeareth eminently in the day of Battel, raiſing the ſpirits on the one ſide, and taking it away from the other. <hi>The Race is not to the ſwift, nor the Battle to the ſtrong,</hi> God over-rules it, gives it where he pleaſes, It is the Lord of Hoſts that muſtereth the Hoſt of the Battle. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 13.4, 5. <hi>The noiſe of a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in the mountains, like as the noiſe of a great people, a tumultuous noiſe of the Kingdoms of nations gathered together: the Lord of Hoſt muſtereth the Hoſt of the Battle, they come from a far country, from the end of heaven, even the Lord, and the weapons of his in dignation.</hi> And therefore we have this as a frequent expreſſion, <hi>The Battle is the Lords,</hi> &amp; hath been uſed for encouragement by thoſe that have been Commanders of the People of God, when in any eminent danger, <hi>Be not afraid, for the Battle is the Lords.</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.47. That the Battle is the Lords, appears by Gods turning the Battle by ſuch a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64965:7"/>ſmall accident as he doth frequently: one ſtone directed right, caſteth the day, as it was with the Philiſtines fighting againſt Iſrael. One arrow drawn at a venture, ſmote the King of Iſrael between the joints of the harneſs, and that one ſtroke turns the day. God covers the head in the day of Battle, God particularly ſaith in every thing, He hath a hand in it, in forming weapons, giving Skill, raiſing the Spirit. God hath a hand in it, and eminently in this, in <hi>Covering the Head in the day of Battle.</hi> How neer doe the Bullets or inſtruments of death come, but God covers the head in the day of Battle: Therefore it is a commendable thing to teach and inſtruct men to be expert for War, becauſe God hath ſo great a hand in it, and doth claim the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The wiſeſt of Rulers, and holieſt of men, have been ſtill care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full about this duty and work, in the acting of this part, making pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for War, in Peace, and in order to it, inſtructing men in the uſe of weapons; the holyeſt, and beſt, and wiſeſt of men, have alwayes had a care about it. <hi>David</hi> made a Law, <hi>he commanded them to teach Iſrael the uſe of the bow.</hi> 2. Sam. 1.18. By that weapon the Worthyes of Iſrael fell, Saul and Jonathan. David made a Law of it, to teach the uſe of that particular weapon, that had been ſo deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to the Church of God. Abraham <hi>Trains</hi> his Servants, Jacob that was ſo eminent for holineſs, was skilfull in the uſe of his ſword &amp; bow; he won a parcel of land by it, that he gave to Joſeph, by Will at his death. <hi>Gen.</hi> 48. <hi>ult.</hi> and that he taught his children the uſe of it, is apparent by the ill uſe of it, made by Simeon and Levi. He had both uſed it himſelf, was expert in the uſe of it, had won a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable portion of a country by it, and had taught it his children, It was apparent they were ſo ready at it. Solomon, that wiſe man, though he enjoyed ſuch peace in his dayes, that it is ſaid, there was no adverſary, nor evil occurrent, yet none made greater preparation for War then Solomon did: the Scripture ſpeaks of it as his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, to make ſuch preparation for war: ſo that the holyeſt, and wiſeſt of men have ſtill had care about this.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The common practice of Nations, in all ages, where the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers have been prudent, have had care of this: and the Scripture brandeth thoſe with infamy that have failed in it. The men of Laiſh were ſecure; in the Book of Judges, the Danites had not taken up their inheritance, they ſent men to Laiſh, <hi>Judg.</hi> 18.7. <hi>Then the five men
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64965:7"/>departed, and came Laiſh and ſaw the people that were therein therein how they dwelt careleſly after the manner of the Zidonians,</hi> quiet and ſecure, &amp; had no buſineſs with any man, they made no proviſion for war, promiſed themſelves peace: theſe were a people fit for deſtruction, it was rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned their great folly and ſhame. That that was a means to their deſtruction, we may be abundantly furniſhed from holy Writ, as well as humane Writing with examples of the care, both of the people of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, and other nations, looking carefully after this matter. <hi>The num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Iſrael, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to goe forth to War:</hi> it implyes the Children of Iſrael with their Rulers, had regard to this, to know who were capable to go forth to War. The number of Iſrael was ſtill taken from their Muſter Rolls; therefore it was committed to the military Officers ſtill to take the number of the people, Joab the General, and ſo the inferiour officers, were ſent out to take the number of the people, and they were reckoned from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go out to War.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The irrational creatures, when ſent by God in way of Judgment, act as if they were under Military Conduct, which ſhews that it is an advantagious thing to carry on a deſign. <hi>Io<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l</hi> 2.7. We read of the Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pillars &amp; the Locuſts, &amp; the Canker-worm, God would ſend them a great Army, they ſhould be like the noiſe of Chariots on the tops of mountains, like the noiſe of a flame of fire that devoureth ſtubble, as a ſtrong people ſet in battle array, they ſhall run like mighty men and climb the wall like men of war, and they ſhall march every one on his wayes, they ſhall not break their Rank. God doth by it commend mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary order to rational perſons, when he tells us the irrational creatures ſent by him in way of Judgment, to accompliſh ſuch deſigns as he by his Providence intendeth, when they ſhall march in this manner, it doth commend to us, that Order uſed in War, Military Diſcipline, is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly advantagious; in that God gives that inſtinct even to irrational crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, when he makes uſe of them that they come in ſuch a manner.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The field or Camp hath been famous for the accompliſhment of of all ſorts of men; it hath ripened parts to that height, that it made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the wonders of the world in their Age.</p>
            <p n="2">II. It is not only a commendable practice, but it is a duty.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Law of nature, which teacheth men ſelf-preſervation, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth this as a means for that end. whatſoever is needfull for our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, is a duty, it requires and enjoynes whatſoever is a means for this end; ſo that acquaintance with, or the exerciſe of our ſelves in the uſe
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64965:8"/>of arms, or other parts of military exerciſe, may be enforced from that Commandment which requires men to uſe all means to preſerve life, to defend themſelves. it were to no end to make a law requiring duty, if to our might we ſhould not uſe the proper means for our own preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation Let but a Prince never ſo great, tread upon a worm, and it will turn; they have that inſtinct in them to defend themſelves. There are our Rights both as Men, and as Chriſtians, our civil Rights and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes as Men and our religious Liberties and Rights as Chriſtians; both which we are to defend with the ſword, as far as we are able, or to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our ſelves to God in the way of duty in doing of it. There is ſuch a thing as Liberty and Property given to us, both by the Laws of God &amp; Men, when theſe are invaded, we may defend our ſelves. God hath not given great ones in the world that abſolute power over men, to devour them at pleaſure, as great Fiſhes do the little ones; he hath ſet Rulers their bounds, &amp; by his Law hath determined peoples libertyes and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty. He that rules over men muſt be juſt that is ſhould be ſo, ruling in the fear of God: therefore Kings are commanded to read the Book of the Law, becauſe it is a boundary of their authority, as well as of the peoples liberty. <hi>Naboths</hi> Vineyard taken away by <hi>Ahab</hi> in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as it was, was revenged by God on <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Jezebel</hi> too. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>f we have that that is our Right and Due, it is not anothers being ſtronger can make our Right Null and void: therefore that Law that gives us a Right, requires attendance on the work of this day, that is Martial exerciſe, in order to the defence of our ſelves by Arms, when the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God puts us upon it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God by his providence keeps ſome Nations and people unſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, as he did with Iſrael of old. he kept ſome people unſubdued on purpoſe to teach Iſrael War. So the Lord hath dealt with us by his Providence here in this wilderneſs, <hi>theſe are the Nations which the Lord left to prove Iſrael by,</hi> thoſe that had not known the Wars of Canaan, only that the generations might know to teach them War. <hi>Judg.</hi> 3.1, 2. It was the duty of Iſrael therefore to learn, that they might be expert for war; for God left ſome nations unſubdued on purpoſe to teach them war. So the Lord hath dealt with us, though he hath given us a good Country, yet not that full poſſeſſion, but that there are ſome which our ſad experience hath taught us, they have been left to teach us war; and therefore it is a duty to keep up ſuch military exerciſes, as may make us expert for VVar.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Our Saviour Chriſts Command is an Argument that it is a Duty,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64965:8"/>
               <hi>he that hath not a Sword, let him ſel his garment and buy one.</hi> Luk. 22.36. which doth infer the learning, the uſe of it, or whatſoever is needfull to defend our ſelves in troubleſome times. It is the duty and wiſdome of any people to put themſelves in ſuch a poſture as they may be fit to defend themſelves: and our Saviours Command, ſhews alſo the uſe of a ſword is as needfull as a garment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he that hath not a ſword, let him ſel his Garment and buy one. Alſo when our Saviour tells us, <hi>in the latter dayes there ſhall be Wars and Rumors of Wars,</hi> more in theſe dayes than at other times; it is to teach us that wiſdome, that we may be found fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and prepared to act our parts in our day. Milittary Skill ought to be taught &amp; learned in the latter dayes more then at other times.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Our Military Strength is, under God, the appointed means, or in the ordinary way of Providence, is the proper and only means for our preſervation; therefore it is a duty to encourage Souldiers. God can work miracles, but when ordinary means may be had, he will not work miracles. When Iſrael came out of Egypt, God did take the Battle into his own hand. So frighted as they were with Egypts following of them in a better poſture for VVar then they, ſo low as their ſpirits were brought by hard bondage, God did miraculouſly fight for them, and deſtroy Pharaoh; but when it is otherwiſe with the People of God, that they have time to furniſh themſelves, the Lord doth direct us to uſe them and they are the only means of our preſervation, they are the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly walls and bulwarks of Gods Herititage here. Gods vineyard hath no other walls, but only our Souldiery, that and our Poverty. We have no walled towns, as they have in other places, our Forts and Caſtles are contemptible, We have not any bank of money to hire ſouldiers: our ſtrength by Sea is ſmall, &amp; for friendſhip &amp; favour in the world with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that ſhould help us, is not much, or our friends lye too far off to help us in time of need; ſo that we have nothing left us but only this, Firſt that hedge which God made about Job, 2. As to means it is only that wall of Bones (as one calls it) better then a wall of Stones, our Souldiers, which, howſoever it may ſeem weak to ſome, yet as when God made the fear of Jacob and his Family fall on the Nations, not one of them durſt to riſe up to diſturb Jacob and his Family. The reſolution that appear'd in Simeon and Levi, together with the fear of God, begat ſuch an awe and dread of that little Family on the Country round about. they knew they were reſolute men, and would ſell their lives dear; this as a means had a great influence upon all round about, that none did dare purſue Jacob; but this hath been our defence. Souldiers have been
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64965:9"/>the Wall, the Strength, the Glory of this little Commonwealth; the name of our military Skill, our readineſs &amp; expertneſs in military exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, is that for which we have been famed abroad in other countryes, both among Dutch and French, What the Governour of <hi>Manadus</hi> ſaw in that little time when he was here, gave us no ſmall credit in <hi>Holland.</hi> What made the Indians live quietly by us ſo long? they had hatred to to us many years before it broke out. What was the reaſon it did not break out? they ſaw we had skill, that Skill in Military Diſcipline which they underſtood not: that was an awe and dread to them, and is at this day, that they dare not meet us on equal terms.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SE.</hi> 1. <hi>Hence it is no wayes unbecoming a Chriſtian to learn to be a Souldier,</hi> not only a Spiritual Souldier, but in the true proper ſence of the letter. To be a Souldier is a Credit, a praiſe and a glory, to be a good Souldier; it is ſo not only to men, but to us as Chriſtians, to have this added to us, to be good Souldiers. It was a part of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams praiſe and glory that he acted the part of a Souldier ſo honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, Nay it is a duty, not a piece of indifferency, but a point of Duty, a praiſe worthy part, he that learns and acts his part honorably. There is ſuch agreement between the Spiritual and temporal Warfare, that every thing belonging to a Souldier, is made uſe of to reſemble ſome Grace or Duty of a Chriſtian, ſomething belonging to a Chriſtian. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of what is outward<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but what may be made ſome Spiritual and good uſe of: As Solomon ſaith, <hi>I beheld the Vineyard of the Slothfull, &amp; from thence I learned Inſtruction.</hi> There is nothing belonging to a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, but be ſure ſome ſpiritual uſe may be made of it, all the parts of his Armour, every one doth exceedingly well ſet out ſome Grace or du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a Chriſtian. <hi>put on the whole Armour of God,</hi> there he ſhews how every thing belonging to a Souldier did ſet forth ſomething which a good man ſhould learn and have. All his weapons all his motions po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy in War are made uſe of to inſtruct a Chriſtian in ſome act of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: the Church Militant is therefore compared to an Army with Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, for Order and for terribleneſs. <hi>Cant.</hi> 6.4, 10. Again, John Baptiſt gives direction to Souldiers on their addreſs to him, to be content with their wages or hire: every one would know their duty, their inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction was to be content with their hire; the work was warrantable, and inſtruction is given for the better ordering of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SE</hi> II. <hi>Hence they are to blame, that either wholly neglect, or ſlight over this work.</hi> If this be ſo becoming a Chriſtian, they are greatly to blame that do neglect it, or ſlight it over, do not make conſcience
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64965:9"/>of it, in endeavouring to fit themſelves, or to teach others to be expert for War: what we have ſuffered by it, is a ſufficient Argument to preſs this; ſome have their Arms to ſeek, when their houſes, or the Towns are beſet; others are ſo ruſty they cannot be uſed: theſe are uncomely things, the want of Arms, or the unfitneſs of them for the work and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice God calls to: It is a great evil to have them defective: Abrahams Souldiers were ready immediately on notice, they had not their arms to ſeek, Abraham was not to buy them, they were ready to purſue and follow the enemy; they were not to <hi>Train</hi> then, to learn to know their order and Rank, but were fitted and prepared being <hi>Trained</hi> before.</p>

The higheſt piece of Service that ever Souldiers were employed in is yet behind; and is commonly believed not to be very far off: the higheſt ſervice that ever was done for the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, the deſtruction of <hi>God and Magog,</hi> ſo the enemies of the Church are called in Scripture; whether it be Pope or Turk; or whoever elſe is meant, that ſhall oppoſe the advancement of the Kingdome of Chriſt: God doth intend his Son ſhall be known and proclaimed as <hi>King of Nations,</hi> as well as <hi>King of Saints, he will take to him his great power and reign, and the Kingdoms of this world ſhall become the Kingdoms of our Lord</hi> &amp; <hi>of his Chriſt</hi> the Lamb will have followers ſuch as ſhall not love their lives to the death, he hath work to do in the world, and work that is even at the door is commonly believed, and therefore we ſhould be exhorted to be the Servants waiting for our Lord. <hi>The Lord Jeſus is not coming to ſend peace on the Earth, but the Sword;</hi> Reformation never went on yet without it; Look at it in <hi>Germany</hi> or <hi>Holland,</hi> or where ever elſe there hath been any attempt firſt or laſt, there hath been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of a War for the defence of it, or for laying the Foundation, the Sword will be drawn upon Chriſts account, and therefore that conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ſhould ſtir us up to keep up this military Skill or Exerciſes, that we may be the better fitted for it.</p>
            <pb n="14" facs="tcp:64965:10"/>
            <p n="2">2. Our own greateſt tryals ſeem to me to be behind, &amp; that for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Reaſons. I apprehend we ſhall not live quiet long, or at leaſt we have no Reaſon to promiſe our ſelves that we ſhall, on theſe accounts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There are none of the Princes of note in <hi>Europe</hi> that have any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in <hi>America,</hi> but have long had their Eſpyals upon us, as I might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily demonſtrate, but the reaſon of the thing it ſelf is ſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us of this, no Merchant but obſerveth anothers motions and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, trading and advantage that he makes, no Husbandman but hath his eye on his Neighbour, to ſee how he profiteth by his labour and pains, that he may do the like; So it is in other things, no Plantation goes on and thrives, but they that have neighbouring plantations are looking or it and obſerving it, our own dayly obſervation may be ſufficient to make us believe this, there is not a ſmall Iſland in <hi>America,</hi> but the Princes or States of <hi>Europe</hi> are ſtriving for it, as we ſee the other day for <hi>Tobage,</hi> St. <hi>Chriſtophers,</hi> &amp;c. if theſe be looked after what can we expect?</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Rome</hi> will have no peace with you, and you ought to have no peace with it, and that <hi>Rome</hi>'s Agents are abroad at work is plain, from that ſire-light we have ſeen in the world, if the Beaſts deadly wound ſhould ever be healed, that we read of in <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. we are like to feel the Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of it, if their Councels ſhould happen to ſway the world, it is a vain thing for us to promiſe our ſelves peace.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The ſins of <hi>New-England</hi> increaſe, <hi>iniquity doth abound, and the Love of many doth wax cold,</hi> and therefore trouble will be, uſually the ſword is one means, by which God puniſheth this ſin in his people, and therefore probability yet of more of it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Inhabitants of the land will not joyn or mix with us to make one Body, which is the more likely they are preſerved to be thorns in our, ſides. When <hi>Hamor</hi> and <hi>Sechem</hi> propounded a firm peace with Jacobs Family, they cry <hi>Let us marry together and make one nation</hi> or people: a Policy uſed by the <hi>French</hi> at this day, not far from us; they may think thereby to eſcape ſome ſcourge that hangs over them; the iſſue of which we muſt leave to God. When God intended the Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anites to be deſtroyed, he did forbid Iſrael to marry with them: they were to be thorns to them and Iſrael was to root them out in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion: therefore frequent trouble, we may probably and rationally reckon of, to meet with from the heathen. Two Nations in are the womb and will be ſtriving. That is a ſecond conſideration, we muſt either learn to defend our ſelves, or reſolve to be vaſſals. It is a baſe ſpirit that of Iſſachar, a ſtrong Aſs couching between two burdens, he ſaw
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64965:10"/>that reſt was good, and the land it was pleaſant, and bowed his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to bear, and became a Servant to tribute. So ſervile are ſome, that they will pay tribute to heathens, rather then endure a little diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty. Low ſpirited men, let them have Iſſachars lot, that make his choice</p>
            <p n="3">3. The World, however pride and luſt diſpoſe them to quarrel, yet are not diſpoſed to breed up ſouldiers, there is ſuch abounding of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance, or debauching that doth wound mens Conſciences, and in the day of danger and trouble will fly in their faces, wounded Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences will be felt then, as it was in the caſe of Joſephs brethren, when they were in diſtreſs, they cry, <hi>we are verily guilty concerning our Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> many humane ſtories might be mentioned for the confirmation of this. Take one. A Captain in the Low Countryes challenged Major-General <hi>Skippon,</hi> the Lord <hi>Veer</hi> hearing of it, told them, to morrow I intend to aſſault ſuch a Town, and then I ſhall ſee who will be the beſt Souldier: accordingly a breach being made in the Wall, this Bravado was commanded to enter, but would not, ſaying, I am not fit to dye. Conſcience will fly in mens faces, when they have eminent ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of death. a man that did not know how to put on his Spur right, if an honeſt man, was wont to be accounted a fitter perſon to make a Souldier, then thoſe that would cry <hi>God damn me</hi> at every word, that ſlight and deſpiſe Hell, and eternal Damnation. Intemperance, Luxury, filthineſs, and uncleaneſs in the world doth ſo debauch men, they are not like to breed up Souldiers for Chriſt, to do ſervice for Chriſt, <hi>he that ſtriveth for Maſtery muſt be temperate in all things.</hi> I will tell you how we breed up Souldiers, both in old England and New, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Farmers Son, when he goes to the Market-Town, muſt have money in his purſe; and when he meets with his Companions, they goe to the Tavern or Ale-houſe, and ſeldome away before Drunk, or well tipled. It is rare to find men that we can call Drunkards, but there are abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Tiplers in <hi>New-England.</hi> This makes Youth effeminate and wanton, beſides the injury to mens Conſciences; this doth make men not ſo bold, <hi>The Righteous are bold as a Lion,</hi> Prov. 28.1.</p>
            <p>It hath been a queſtion whether Athieſme or Piety have made the better Souldiers? late experience as well as this of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> doth teach us, that a well eſtabliſhed Conſcience, is better then a ſeared Conſcience to fill a man with Courage: ſome fill themſelves with drink, to make them forget the fear of death, but <hi>David</hi> that was a couragious Souldier, knew no way ſo fit to animate his Spirit as to go to the promiſe of God; to encourage himſelf in God, fulneſs of Corn
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64965:11"/>and wine cannot heighten and raiſe the ſpirits of men, ſo as aſſurance of the love of God. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.6, 7. a well eſtabliſhed Conſcience, Faith in the promiſes, is above all ſuch means as the poor ſimple ſinfull world uſeth. That Atheiſme cannot do ſo much as a good Conſcience, may appear from two Reaſons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe an Atheiſt hath no aſſurance of a Reward, whereas a Believer hath. That ſhould make a Believer more couragious, becauſe he is ſure of a Reward: when a man goes to the Battle it is uncertain whether he ſhall out-live the Battle, and alſo it is uncertain whether he ſhall have the victory; and if either of theſe happen, an Atheiſt hath no reward, if he looſe the day or looſe his life: but a true Chriſtian is aſſured of his Reward. He that doth what he doth, as ſervice to God <hi>we know our labour is not in vain in the Lord;</hi> he muſt needs be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſpirited for his work.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A true Chriſtian is a gainer by Death; it is not ſo with an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſt, <hi>To me to dye is gain,</hi> Phil. 1 21. Therfore ſaith Solomon, <hi>the day of Death is better then the day of a mans Birth,</hi> viz. to the Saints, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is an end of all a mans ſin and ſorrow, and the beginning of his never-ending Joy. He that fighteth in the Faith of this, muſt needs out doe one that hath no ſuch expectation: an Atheiſt reckoneth of nothing in the world to come, he can believe for no reward in the world to come, that thinketh there is no God; He cannot be ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturous in looking Death in the face, as he that knows he ſhall be a Gainer by Death. It is Hope that animateth all our work. The hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then that had not true peace of Conſcience, yet had ſome ſence of the natural Conſcience excuſing,<note place="margin">Non tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidus Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. &amp;c. <hi>Hor.</hi>
               </note> and doe expreſs it in a ſtrange manner. What is it ſuch a man needs to fear? it is not all the violent ſtorms he can be in or hazzard by them: not the cruelty of Tyrants, nor though the world ſhould ruſh together. It is but an Heathen ſpeech, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth a ſtrange apprehenſion they had of the benefit of peace of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Conſcience: they knew not peace with God. A man that is whole and ſound within, may better look Death in the Face, then any other, from any other Conſideration. The Pſalmiſt expreſſeth it in another manner, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1 12.7. <hi>He ſhall not be afraid of evil Tidings, his heart is fixed truſting in the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. To come to ſome <hi>Directions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. To ſuch as repreſent Abraham, Rulers in the Commonwealth, both Civil and Military; God expecteth from you that you ſhould act Abrahams part. 1. I would ſpeak a few words of Encouragement to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64965:11"/>you. 2. By way of Direction. For <hi>Encouragement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Through the goodneſs and favour of God, you have a people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you that have Spirit and Courage enough. that have a large ſhare of that: a great bleſſing to this country, a mercy that we have all cauſe to bleſs God for: there hath rather been an exceſs of Courage, then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect or want of it; moſt of our loſſes have been occaſioned meerly by it. You have men full of activity and Courage, forward enough, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding danger. You have a People bred up in this Country, that have the heart of Lions, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12.8. Or Lion-like men. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 11.22. What is ſaid of the Horſe, one may by way of ſimilitude apply to men. <hi>He mocks at fear, he is not afraid, neither turns he back from the ſword.</hi> Job. 39.22-25. I ſpeak this becauſe I have ſeen and heard ſomething my ſelf of the Courage of Souldiers, that hath been better and more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing then the greateſt Daintyes or Feaſt could be: to ſee the hearts of men raiſed in danger, rather then caſt down with it. The ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of men to be raiſed and heightned in danger, if we had the Mines of <hi>Mexico</hi> and <hi>Peru,</hi> it would not be ſuch a mercy and bleſſing to the Country as this is.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They can endure hardneſs, that is another thing by way of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to Rulers, that is a great mercy. A tender, ſoftly, effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate People is a curſe and miſery, when God is pleaſed to frame a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be ſuch. And by the way, I might encourage Rulers, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours and Parents to train &amp; bring up their Children in ſuch manner that they may endure <hi>Hardneſs.</hi> Thô Iſaac was a great Prince, as the king of the Philiſtines acknowledged him, yet when he ſent away Jacob, he ſent not ſo much as a Servant with him; he took of the ſtones, &amp; made a pillow of them; it was a hard pillow, had no feathers in it; but when he had the hardeſt nights lodging, he had the beſt nights reſt. <hi>He ſaw a Viſion of a Ladder reaching to heaven:</hi> it was as comfortable a night as ever Jacob had. Iſaac was a Prince, acknowledged by the King of the Philiſtines, yet he brings up Jacob in ſuch a manner, that he ſhould not complain of this hardneſs, to be ſent out alone, to lye in the woods, &amp; have nothing but a ſtone for his pillow, to have a piece of bread in his pocket, and water to drink, he did endure without murmuring and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining. It is probable his Father did not bring him up deliciouſly.</p>
            <p>One leaving of <hi>New-England,</hi> did commend that to Parents. You doe not know what hardneſs your Children may be called to.</p>
            <p>By way of Advice, two or three words.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Require of all the exerciſe of <hi>Trainings,</hi> or attendance upon
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64965:12"/>them: That Rulers ſhould look unto, that they may have Souldiers ready for any Expedition. There are good Laws, but there needs ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the execution of them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Keep up martial Diſcipline: a Souldier is the worſt of creatures that is not under Diſcipline, and ſuch as are Commanders ſhould look to that. You know the praiſe-worthy example of the Centurion, <hi>I ſay to one goe, and he goeth, and to another come, aend he cometh,</hi> Mat. 8.9. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline is the life of the work. Captains are greatly to blame, that are ſoftly men, and do not hold their authority in the field. That which would be no fault, or might be winked at at home, ſhould not be ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Field.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Encourage your Horſe, thoſe exerciſes alſo. Foreign Princes know they can eaſily over-maſter you in Foot, but know not how to over-maſter you in Horſe. They that have had an aking tooth at this place, have been afraid of this; that have Foot-Souldiers enough at our backs, yet know not how to match us in Horſe.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Look with a favourable aſpect upon, and afford your preſence as much as may be, at ſuch Meetings as are the work of this day. Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage <hi>Artilery-Trainings.</hi> 1. It is a way and means to give encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to dilligent and expert Men, by giving them titles anſwerable to their activity and skill. In Grammar-Schools, to be a Captain for a day, makes young Schollars ſtrive at their Books. It is a way that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordeth opportunity to put honour and reſpect upon Men of activity, as their Dilligence, Valour and activity calls for it. The Law of nature teacheth, that the virtuous Skil of any doth call for honour. 2. It is a Nurſery for Officers beyond our common Trainings, or a better means to accompliſh thoſe that are Officers, <hi>Artilery Meetings</hi> conſiſting in a great meaſure of ſuch. It is alſo a proper means for trying the Skill of Souldiers beyond what is at other times.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A few words to inferiour Officers and Souldiers, to ſuch as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent Abrahams Servants, labour to be good Souldiers, and to that end, Fellow-Souldiers, I would commend a few things, 1. Something to you as Chriſtian Souldiers. 2. Something to you as Souldiers Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral, or men.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Something as Chriſtian-Souldiers, only theſe two words,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Get Armour of proof <hi>put on the whole Armour of God,</hi> that is the way to make a good Souldier, to have his compleat Armour, Armour for his inward man; without there be a Guard to that, there will be a Failing: if the Conſcience be wounded, or be not ſafe, if the <hi>Breaſt-plate
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64965:12"/>of Righteouſneſs</hi> be not on, if men have guilty Conſciences, they will find and feel the ſad effects of it, when they come to be in danger, <hi>Put on your ſpiritual Armour,</hi> look to that <hi>Breſt-plate of Righteouſneſs.</hi> I would commend the keeping of a good Conſcience: with that Breſt-plate a man may look Death in the Face. When the vitals are ſecured, a man that hath any Courage or Spirit, will not vallue a ſcratch in the arm or leg. If a man have a good Breſt-plate and large, ſufficient to defend his Vitals, it will make a man bold; he knows that ordinarily he is ſecured as for his life; and he that hath any ſpirit will venture his Limbs. Take care of your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man therefore, as you would make good Souldiers. Look to your inward man, the Heart, that that be wel guarded and defended, that you have a good Breſt-plate for the defence of that. Abraham firſt taught Piety: Engage God with you, and that would make a very coward fight. For a man to have his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience againſt him in the day of Battle, is a very ſad thing, it frighteth a man far more than the enemy. <hi>God is departed from me, and anſwerethme no more, and the Philiſtines are upon me:</hi> That made the Philiſtines as bad as ſo many Devils to him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Be Temperate and endure hardneſs, do not live as if your great ſtudy were to pleaſe the fleſh; one that is given to appetite, will never credit the profeſſion of a Souldier nor himſelf.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A hint or two to you as Souldiers.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Be in ſubjection to Officers, to thoſe God ſets over you: to diſpute com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands is unbecoming a Souldier, <hi>I am a man under Authority, and ſay to one goe and he goes,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Centurion,</hi> Luk. 7.5.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Goe to, or attend upon Trainings as thoſe that do not reckon it a Task, but account it your Recreation, and Priviledge, as thoſe that have a mind to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert in war. The Lord Jeſus when he calls out any, they ſhall not be bunglers, it will not be long ere the Lord Jeſus will call out Souldiers, thoſe that he will uſe ſhall be expert for War, and therefore let us accuſtome our ſelves to this work, that fatal blow at <hi>Black-point</hi> ſhould make men love <hi>Training;</hi> the unreadineſs they were in there, they were raw &amp; undiſciplined: let us labour to be expert for War; to be like our General Ieſus Chriſt. <hi>The Lord is a man of War.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, look to your Arms, that becomes a Souldier to keep them fixed, and to be expert in the uſe of them, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.18. according to that of <hi>David, be comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to teach them the uſe of the Bow.</hi>
